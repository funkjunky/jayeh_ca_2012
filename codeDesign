formal code design document for jayeh.ca
----------------------------------------

Principles:
-Data, Design, and process are all completely seperated.
-ZERO redundency in code (ie. very modular)
-All JS is built using libraries
-everything is extendable
-general template, and topic template. The topic template is optional.

Specific cues:
-all links will work without javascript enabled
-all local page links will evaluate what data the page needs to dynamically update and only pull and update that data, while changing the url.
